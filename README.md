### Modeling Progression of Chronic Disease

**Note**: For the Alzheimerâ€™s and Multiple myeloma progression modeling tasks, the data is not publicly available, but the code which produced the results is still found in this repository. 

#### Alzheimer's progression modelling
Code is found in */notebooks/ADNI.ipynb* and */src/adni/*

#### Multiple myeloma progression modelling
Code is found in */notebooks/mm-prfs.ipynb* and */notebooks/mm-tr.ipynb*
